    Inarguably, software has become an integral part of modern life. Unfortunately, software's predictable and efficient
    construction is far from settled practice. Formally, Software Engineering (SE) aims to provide a framework to
    develop software products and systems using well-defined scientifically backed procedures that produce reliable and
    efficient enough software appropriate for a particular situation. Observationally, Software Engineering isn't
    predictably achieving these aims, though plenty of software is produced.


    A potential factor in SE's shortcomings could be due to the fact that learning Software Engineering can be quite
    challenging. What SE is at its core may be fairly constant, but the specifics people focus on, more often than not,
    change rapidly. Expert practitioners acknowledge tech variability, poor communication skills, and avoidance or
    ignorance of externalities that can overwhelm all SE efforts and complicate learning the topic.


    This course aims to help students build a foundation of thinking skills, theoretical knowledge, and practical
    application in the form of a project. The course also provides exposure to pragmatic industry-tested experience from
    the Professor and fellow students.


    To meet this grand challenge, the course aims to teach:

    Research and Analysis Skills
    Communication Skills
    Thinking Skills
    Fundamental Truths from Theoretical (Software) Engineering
    To demonstrate the application of these ideas, we will also develop one project out of a small set of ideas. The
    practical portion of the course should allow you to demonstrate understanding and execution of the complete set of
    Agile procedures and hopefully produce a product that meets the following criteria:

    Has complete and useful documentation
    Is fully tested and reviewed
    Exhibits only explainable code smells
    Has a user-focused interface that has been vetted by others
    Uses a modern build pipeline for predictable production
    A successful project should be able to be observed or picked up by any reasonably skilled developer.

    To reduce risk and increase the likelihood of a successful outcome, the project will purposefully be limited in
    scope and design choices. The typical free-form nature of a project will be eliminated this term, and this offering
    may even offer a chance to explore the recovery or migration of an existing code base. The project effort specifics
    will be worked out based on student background and class interest.

    Readings and Resources
    The course has an overarching book Modern Software Engineering by Dave Farley (ISBN: 978-0-13-731491-1). It should
    be available via the bookstore but can be found more cheaply online Links to an external site.. The book is
    required, and we will read the entire book before our eventual evaluation effort.

    Other readings will be assigned in class including some classic SWE papers, current web posts, and even a YouTube
    presentation or two. You are responsible for reviewing assigned readings BEFORE the lecture, as interactions will
    assume knowledge of the materials assigned.



    Project Preview
    After a coding warm-up that includes reading and writing of code we will work on a small, though not trivial,
    application in vanilla web tech. The application will be produced with all the expected aspects of software
    engineering (clean code, full unit test coverage, etc.), fully documented, and buildable by outsiders with limited
    ramp-up time. We will offer or assign a choice between a brownfield and a greenfield project. The project will not
    be open-ended and will have constraints beyond the limited available time. A significant class goal will be that all
    team projects are superior to efforts made by undergraduates in an SE course.
